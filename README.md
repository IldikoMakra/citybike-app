## Get Started with Development

Clone this repository first

```bash

git clone https://github.com/IldikoMakra/citybike-app.git

```

Step into the root folder and install server

```bash

cd citybike-app
npm install

```

Change directory to the client folder, install packages

cd client
npm install

```

Step back to the root folder, rename and set the .env file
Email me to get your own DB password.

```bash

cd ..
mv .envtochange .env

```

After password set you should be able to start developing with one command only from the root folder:

```bash

npm run dev

```

- See frontend on port localhost:3000
- API on port localhost:8080

## Testing only from your local computer

Clone the repository

```bash

git clone https://github.com/IldikoMakra/citybike-app.git

Change directory to the client folder, install packages and build the frontend to be served from localhost:8080 too.

```bash

cd client
npm install
npm run build

```

Step back to the root folder, rename and set the .env file

Email me to get your own DB password.

```bash
